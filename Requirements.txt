Requirements:
- The heat camera could be expensive, and will not work for avalanche victims or in snowstorms, as it only takes the temperature of the 
surface, and therefore only of the snow.
- Good idea, however, would be an avalanche transmitter, which can find the general direction of the transmitter and also knows the 
strength. This would be very useful if it were included in the robot so it can work automatically.
- It will have a particular way to dig in the snow - in the front it will have some sort of horizontal brush that spins on a motor to 
break up snow and clear it away, with a sort of vacuum right behind it to clear the snow.
- The robot should probably have a heating feature (this isnâ€™t absolutely necessary, but a good idea)
- It should be lightweight and easily movable, so rescuers can carry it on their back to ski or snowboard quickly to the avalanche 
location
- Probably treadmills to move around in the snow, with skis in the front for fast travel.
- If the avalanche transmitter is integrated into the robot, the robot should have a screen on its back showing where the signal is.
- The robot should be able to switch to manual mode, with a screen showing the state of the robot (temperature, battery, etc.), as well 
as where the avalanche transmitter is pointing.
